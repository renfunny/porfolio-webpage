# My Porfolio Website

## Description

This website was created to showcase past projects that I have worked on as well as to practice and further my knowledge in the Front-end aspect of web-development.
The goal of this website is to attract potential employers who may be looking for capable employees to join their team. This website will allow them to get to know me
a bit better as well as show my current abilities for web-development. This webpage will continue to evolve as I further my knowlegde in the UofT bootcamp.
Building this website allowed me to be further introduced to concepts like flexbox, grid, as well as many other properties in CSS. Being able to practice all these
concepts and play around with them helped me understand them better and realize when to utilize them appropriately. It also allowed me to find many resources online
that provide things like free logos, pre-made gradients, free fonts, etc.

## Installation

This website will require downloads for the logos and the fonts used, this should be done automatically upon opening the website.

## Usage

The website is very intuitive (I hope). So to use it you can start by [Clicking Here!](https://renfunny.github.io/porfolio-webpage/). You may scroll down to see more content or you can use the navbar to be taken to a specific
section of the webpage. The "About Me" button will take you to a different webpage, if you wish to go back to the main page you may click the "Renato Cordova" button
on the left of the navbar. All the social media buttons work and will open a new tab if clicked, except for the "Resume" button which will only cause the page to reload.
Below I have provided a screenshot of the webpage which includes the navbar for the navigation of the webpage.
